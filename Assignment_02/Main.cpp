//Grade: 100/100
//Amazing job! Congrats!


//TODO:  
//Question 1:
//How much time does the following method take? Use the big-O notation in terms
//of the parameter n.
int foo_1(int n)
{
    int counter = 0;
    int current = 1;
    while (current < n)
    {
        counter++;
        current *= 2;
    }
    return current;
}
//Answer: O(log n) - Because current is being multiplied by 2 everytime the loop is happening.
//So, the current will be equal or greater than n more quickly!


//TODO:
//Question 2: The methods "pow_a" and "pow_b" bellow determines m to the power of n without using
//math libraries. How much time each one of the methods take using big - O notation in terms of n.
int pow_a(int m, int n)
{
    int ret = 1;
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        ret *= m;
    }
    return ret;
}
//Answer for pow_a: O(n) - whatever value n has is going to change the time it takes to complete 
//the algorithm linearly. 

int pow_b(int m, int n) {
    int ret = 1;
    int k = m;
    int i = n;
    while (i > 0)
    {
        if (i % 2 == 1) ret *= k;
        k *= k;
        i /= 2;
    }
    return ret;
}
//Answer for pow_b: O(log n) - i which is equal to n in this function, is divided by 2 inside the 
//while loop. Just like the first question, n will be equal to 0 more quickly.

//TODO:
//Question 3:
//The method bellow finds and removes duplicated numbers in the parameter array. 
//Note that it has three loops. Using Big O notation, in terms of the length of the arr, how
//much time this function takes ?
int removeDuplicates(char arr[], int n)
{
    int len = n;
    int i = 0;           // index of current item to find
    while (i < len)
    {
        int j;           // will be index of duplicate of arr[i]
        for (j = i + 1; j < len; j++)
        {
            if (arr[i] == arr[j]) break;
        }
        if (j == len)
        {   // no duplicate of arr[i] found; go to next i
            i++;
        }
        else
        {         // duplicate found; shift array over arr[j]
            for (int k = j + 1; k < len; k++)
            {
                arr[k - 1] = arr[k];
            }
            len--;
            arr[len] = 0;
        }
    }
    return len;
}
//Answer: O(n^2) - There are 2 for loops inside a while loop. Big-O notation would look something
//like this --> n * (n + n) = 2n^2, but the number 2 is not going to make any changes, so the final
//answer would be O(n^2) which n square or n to the power of 2.

//TODO:
//Question 4: 
//Write an exponential function that returns an array with 
//the multiplications results which has the time complexity O(n) and a space complexity O(n)
//For example: Pow(3, 3) means that is 3 ^ 3 and the returned array will be: [1, 3, 9, 27]
int* Pow(int n, int e)
{
    int order = e + 1;
    int* arr = new int[order]();

    for (int i = 0; i < order; ++i)
    {
        arr[i] = pow_b(n, i);
    }

    return arr;
}

//TODO:
//Question 5:
//Create a display function that prints an array of size n with this format:
// [2, 3, 4, 1, 6, 20, 0]
void DisplayArray(int* arr, int n)
{
    std::cout << "[ ";
    for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
    {
        std::cout << arr[i];

        if (i == n - 1)
        {
            std::cout << " ";
        }
        else
        {
            std::cout << ", ";
        }
    }
    std::cout << "]" << std::endl;
}

//TODO: This question is optional. It's bonus if you don't search or copy anything from the internet.
//There are no wrong answers. Interview questions like this one is just to evaluate how you think.
//Of course that you can find this question on the internet, but try not to. Think about what is the worst case scenario.
//and how can you make this better.

//Question 6: EA's and Google's Interview question

//You work in a 100 floor building and you get 2 identical eggs. 
//You need to figure out the highest floor an egg can be dropped without breaking. 
//Find an algorithm that is minimizing number of throws in the worst-case scenario.
//Code is not necessary. You can explain with your own words.
//You can make some assumptions like:
//1)If an egg doesn’t break when dropped from some floor, then it will not break when dropped from any lower floors.
//2)An egg that survives a fall can be used again.
//3)A broken egg must be discarded.
//4)The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs.
//5)If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor.
